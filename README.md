# chalkboard

`chalkboard` aims to provide a simple yet flexible drawing API for a wide variety of backends. Design choices are inspired by `cairo`, but diverges in many places.

## Crates

- `chalkboard` is the entire point.
- The `chalkboard-geometry` crate provides several geometric primitives,
  used not only in `chalkboard` but elsewhere as well.
